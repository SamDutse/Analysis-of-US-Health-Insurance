# Analysis-of-US-Health-Insurance-Using-MS-SQL
## INTRODUCTION
I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Insurance dataset using SQL to provide insights into the healthcare industry. Here's a brief overview of what I did:

## ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
- Explored the data by viewing the top 10 rows, checking for null values, and identifying outliers using statistical measures.
- Standardized the categorical variables by transforming the smoker variable from yes and no to 1's and 0's.
- Created a new variable based on age and sex to provide a more detailed view of the data.
- Calculated the average healthcare costs by region to identify the region with the highest costs.
- Identified the top 10 policyholders with the highest healthcare costs.
- Categorized insurance cover users based on BMI, creating a new variable BMI_Classification.
- Explored the number of insurance cover by region.
- Built a linear regression model to predict healthcare costs based on age, BMI, and smoker status.

The findings of this project provide insights into the healthcare industry, which can help stakeholders make informed decisions. The results of the linear regression model can be used to predict healthcare costs for policyholders (which i will create a calculator using Excel), which can be beneficial for insurance companies.
